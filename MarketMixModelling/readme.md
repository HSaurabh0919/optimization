### Reach 

As more money is invested in a marketing
channel, its effect diminishes as the advertising
becomes saturated and the relevant customers
are reached.

### Carryover

Some marketing channels, such as television advertising, have delayed effects. For example,
a customer could see the television ad during the week, but order insurance at the weekend
when the person has time.
